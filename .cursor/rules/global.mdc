# PROJECT NAME

**THE USER MUST REPLACE THIS SECTION WITH THEIR OWN PROJECT NAME AND DESCRIPTION.**

EXAMPLE: A modern and fast (rolldown + oxc based) Vue 3 starter template with TypeScript, file-based type safe routing, data fetching, state management, and comprehensive tooling.

## Standards

MUST FOLLOW THESE RULES, NO EXCEPTIONS

- Stack: Vue.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS v4, Vue Router, Pinia, Pinia Colada
- Patterns: ALWAYS use Composition API + `<script setup>`, NEVER use Options API
- ALWAYS Keep types alongside your code, use TypeScript for type safety, prefer `interface` over `type` for defining types
- Keep unit and integration tests alongside the file they test: `src/ui/Button.vue` + `src/ui/Button.spec.ts`
- ALWAYS use TailwindCSS classes rather than manual CSS
- DO NOT hard code colors, use Tailwind's color system
- ONLY add meaningful comments that explain why something is done, not what it does
- Dev server is already running on `http://localhost:5173` with HMR enabled. NEVER launch it yourself
- ALWAYS use named functions when declaring methods, use arrow functions only for callbacks
- ALWAYS prefer named exports over default exports

## Project Structure

Keep this section up to date with the project structure. Use it as a reference to find files and directories.

EXAMPLES are there to illustrate the structure, not to be implemented as-is.

## Project Commands

Frequently used commands:

- `pnpm run build`: bundles the project for production
- `pnpm run test`: runs all tests
- `pnpm exec vitest run <test-files>`: runs one or multiple specific test files
  - add `--coverage` to check missing test coverage

## Development Workflow

ALWAYS follow the workflow when implementing a new feature or fixing a bug. This ensures consistency, quality, and maintainability of the codebase.

1. Plan your tasks, review them with user. Include tests when possible
2. Write code, following the [project structure](#project-structure) and [conventions](#standards)
3. **ALWAYS test implementations work**:
   - Write [tests](#using-playwright-mcp-server) for logic and components
   - Use the Playwright MCP server to test like a real user
4. Stage your changes with `git add` once a feature works
5. Review changes and analyze the need of refactoring

## Testing Workflow

## Unit and Integration Tests

- Test critical logic first
- Split the code if needed to make it testable

### Using Playwright MCP Server

1. Navigate to the relevant page
2. Wait for content to load completely
3. Test primary user interactions
4. Test secondary functionality (error states, edge cases)
5. Check the JS console for errors or warnings
   - If you see errors, investigate and fix them immediately
   - If you see warnings, document them and consider fixing if they affect user experience
6. Document any bugs found and fix them immediately

## Research & Documentation

- **NEVER hallucinate or guess URLs**
- ALWAYS try accessing the `llms.txt` file first to find relevant documentation. EXAMPLE: `https://pinia-colada.esm.dev/llms.txt`
  - If it exists, it will contain other links to the documentation for the LLMs used in this project
- ALWAYS follow existing links in table of contents or documentation indices
- Verify examples and patterns from documentation before using

## MCP Servers

You have these MCP servers configured globally:

- **Playwright**: Browser automation for visual testing and UI interactions. Use this server when testing UI changes (Playwright can navigate, screenshot, and interact)

Note: These are user-level servers available in all your projects.
